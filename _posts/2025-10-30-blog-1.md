**Welcome to Black Sail Editing**, a small, women-owned editing business for national security and fantasy women-centered stories. I’m Sydney, and I am so glad you’re here.

There is an untold power in the stories we carry. The ones forged in high-stakes rooms, late-night strategy sessions, and across oceans where service and sacrifice often go unseen.

For many women in national security, defense, and government, those stories are lived every day, yet rarely told. They exist in the margins of reports, in the email drafts unsent, in whispered moments between deployments, in memories that shaped who we are and how we lead.

At **Black Sail Editing**, we believe those stories deserve to be written, refined, and shared with the clarity and confidence they deserve.

> At Black Sail Editing, I believe every woman who’s served in the shadows of national security, government, or defense has a story worth telling, one that can inspire future generations to follow in their footsteps, inspired and informed by those that came before them. My mission is to help you find that story, refine it, and bring it to life with clarity, authenticity, and strength.

## **Our Mission at Black Sail Editing**

After a decade in national security, I know what it means to work in environments where precision and communication are everything. Whether leading cyber operations, drafting policy, or managing teams across continents, I learned that *how* we tell a story can be just as impactful as the story itself.

I founded **Black Sail Editing** with a simple but powerful mission: to **empower women in national security, defense, and government to tell their stories**, the ones that inspire, challenge, and redefine what leadership looks like.

Through manuscript editing, book coaching, and ghostwriting, I help clients find their voice, shape their message, and bring their books to life with purpose and polish. My work is purpose-driven, creative, and strategic, much like the careers of the women I serve.

## **Why Your Story Matters**

<br>For too long, women in these fields have been the backbone of history-making work without always being part of the narrative. You’ve led with strength, adapted in uncertainty, and built bridges between policy and people, often quietly, diligently, and brilliantly.

Your story isn’t “just another memoir” or “the first woman to do \[x, y, z\]”. It’s a testament to resilience, leadership, and transformation. It’s a roadmap for the next generation of leaders (not just women!) stepping into national security, tech, or diplomacy.

And whether you want to write your own story or build an entirely new world through fiction, your voice is the compass that will guide readers through it.

## **From Strategy to Storytelling**

Editing and coaching are more than grammar or structure. They are tools for amplifying your clarity and impact. I approach storytelling with the same mindset I used in my previous career: strategic precision, empathy, and a deep respect for complexity.

Together, we’ll:

* Uncover the *core narrative* that drives your story.
* Strengthen your voice so it feels both authentic to you and to your audience.
* Shape your manuscript and drafts into compelling, cohesive, and unforgettable pieces.

I offer three main services to help you navigate this process:

1. **Manuscript Editing** – for refining clarity, tone, and structure.
2. **Book Coaching** – for personalized guidance throughout the writing journey.
3. **Ghostwriting** – for transforming your experiences and ideas into a professionally written book that still sounds like *you.*

## **Where Experience Meets Imagination**

Although my professional roots are in strategy and operations, I have always believed in the power of imagination. Living abroad in South Korea and Germany showed me how storytelling transcends language and culture, and how fantasy, in particular, allows us to explore identity and courage in unexpected ways.

At **Black Sail Editing**, I don’t separate the analytical from the creative. I see them as two sides of the same coin: both essential for crafting stories that resonate deeply and endure.

## **Charting a New Course**

Every woman I’ve met in national security or government has a story that could shift a narrative, illuminate a hidden truth, or inspire someone else to take the helm.

My mission is to help you chart that course: to bring your journey from the shadows into the light, where it can spark conversations and create change.

If you’re ready to begin your writing journey, I’d be honored to be your partner in the process. Whether you’re polishing your manuscript, exploring a memoir, or dreaming of your first novel, I’m here to help your story sail forward. Reach out to me on my [contact page](/contact) so we can set up a time to talk about your project, your goals, and how we can bring your vision to life. Or <a href="https://blacksailediting.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subscribe</a> to **The Black Sail Logbook**  where I’ll be sharing writing tips, reflections on storytelling, and the books that continue to inspire bold voices.

More to come. Thanks for joining us on this journey.
