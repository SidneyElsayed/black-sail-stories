      <h2>Empowering you</h2>At <em>Black Sail Editing</em>, my mission is to
      empower women in national security and government roles by helping them
      tell their stories. Whether you’re looking to refine your manuscript, need
      guidance through the book-writing process, or seek a trusted partner to
      bring your vision to life through ghostwriting, I’m here to ensure your
      voice is heard—strong, clear, and unforgettable.

      With a decade of experience in national security, I know firsthand what it
      takes to navigate high-stakes environments and the importance of clear,
      impactful communication. From cyber operations to international policy, my
      work has been rooted in strategy, precision, and understanding complex
      global issues—skills I now bring to the world of writing, editing, and
      coaching.<p>But beyond the strategy and operations, I’ve had the privilege
      of living abroad in South Korea and Germany, where I encountered countless
      women in defense, intelligence, and government sectors—each one fierce,
      resilient, and pioneering. It is these women’s stories that inspire me to
      help amplify their voices.</p><p>I also understand the importance of
      fantasy in transporting readers to fictional realms where they can
      discover new parts of themselves that they can take off the page into
      their every day lives.</p><p>I believe that stories have the power to not
      only shift narratives but to inspire future generations of women in these
      fields. Let’s chart a course for your story together—one that reflects
      your strength, your journey, and your impact on the world.</p>
