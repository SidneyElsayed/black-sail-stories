      <p>With a decade of experience in national security, I know firsthand what
      it takes to navigate high-stakes environments and the importance of clear,
      impactful communication. From cyber operations to international policy, my
      work has been rooted in strategy, precision, and understanding complex
      global issues—skills I now bring to the world of writing, editing, and
      coaching.</p><p>But beyond the strategy and operations, I’ve had the
      privilege of living abroad in South Korea and Germany, where I encountered
      countless women in defense, intelligence, and government sectors—each one
      fierce, resilient, and pioneering. It is these women’s stories that
      inspire me to help amplify their voices.</p><p>I also understand the
      importance of fantasy in transporting readers to fictional realms where
      they can discover new parts of themselves that they can take off the page
      into their every day lives.</p><p>I believe that stories have the power to
      not only shift narratives but to inspire future generations of women in
      these fields. Let’s chart a course for your story together—one that
      reflects your strength, your journey, and your impact on the world.</p>
